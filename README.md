### NounFour 

Noun four facilitates splitting a single Noun into four NFTs, each derived from a different part of the Noun
- body
- head
- accessory
- glasses

My motivation was that I feel Nouns are friendly too a highly bespoke sort of fractionalization/collective ownership: 
- you can naturally break a Noun into a several parts, giving each holder something unique
- holders can plug into Nouns governance in a tailored way

I would love to see a version of this for the Nouns auction, as well. Like PartyBid/PartyNoun but with more explicit outcomes/limitations. 

#### TODO
[] Test
[] Governance functionality
[] Traits
